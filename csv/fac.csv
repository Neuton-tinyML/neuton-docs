"Which is the lowest cost IMU work effectively with Neuton Ai for industrial predictive maintenance use? I am using Edge Impulse on Arduino, exploring alternative for STM IMU instead of MCU for lower cost and design optimize.","Even with programmable IMUs from ST, like the ISM330IS, they do not have non-volatile memory. This means that even if you could program and run Neuton models inside such an IMU, you would still need to upload firmware on each boot cycle (power cycle) from an MCU via I2C. We are interested in discussing your case in more detail. Could you let us know your time zone? We’d like to find a slot that works best for you."
"I am using a witmotion WT9011DCL-BT50 9 dof IMU to gather data from the flight of a frisbee disc. Can I use Neuton to analyze the flight pattern and determine key points in the pattern, such as the initial start of the wind-up, the release point, the point of maximum speed, the point of maximum elevation, etc.? Must the neural network code be loaded onto the IMU, or can it be used/worked with in a software analysis program, such as Android Studio?","Using the Neuton platform, you can solve supervised classification/regression tasks and perform unsupervised anomaly detection. For instance, if you want to predict when a frisbee disc flips over in the air, you will need to label the corresponding sensor signals: assign label 0 for steady flight and label 1 for when the frisbee flips over. This labeled data can be used to train a classification model on the Neuton platform. Once deployed on the frisbee's MCU, the model can detect when the frisbee flips over during flight and execute predefined logic. Additionally, you can train an unsupervised anomaly detection model on the platform using recorded signal data from normal frisbee flights without labeling the data. This model can then detect anomalies such as the frisbee hitting a building or flipping over unexpectedly. Analyzing the signal data collected from your application involves manually plotting out different parts of the signal and conducting analysis."
i cant find neuton.c and neuton.h files  ,"With the Neuton.ai platform, only precompiled libraries are accessible in the ./neuton/lib folder. If you require source code access, please contact us via the following form and explain your use-case: https://neuton.ai/contactus."
will I get c downloadable files supported by arduino nano ble 33 sense,"Arduino is not currently natively supported on the Neuton platform, but compatibility will be included in future platform updates."
how to enable tinyML?,"TinyML is at the core of the platform and is enabled by default. However, Neuton offers a Digital Signal Processing option to help preprocess raw data, which is essential for many TinyML use cases."
how to use audio data?,Neuton.AI currently does not support audio data processing.
Can you self host the neuton trainer?,"At present, model training is exclusively available through the Neuton.ai TinyML platform."
does neuton allow to train images? ,"Not at the moment, but image processing is on our roadmap."
can I use my own model architecture?,"The Neuton Neural Network Framework automatically grows its structure neuron by neuron, ensuring minimal model size with excellent generalization and no loss of accuracy. Since Neuton does not require a predefined architecture, there is no need for a network architecture input option."
Your model training service seems to be cloud-based only. Do you provide it for on-prem servers as well?,"Currently, we do not provide on-premises model training services. However, we encourage you to fill out the following form: https://neuton.ai/contactus so we can discuss your needs in more detail."
Are the 8-bit models more accurate than the 16-bit ones? ,"There is no strict dependency. In many cases, the metrics of an 8-bit model may differ only slightly from those of a 16-bit model, while the model itself remains more compact."
Are the floating-point models more accurate than the integer-only ones?,"It depends on the data. The model accuracy may stay the same or even improve with a float-based model. However, the key advantage of an integer-based model is its increased compactness."
why there are two numbers in the precision results  ,"When binary classification is used, the platform provides metrics for both classes, allowing you to evaluate the performance of the model for each class separately."
What kinds of datasets does your approach work on?,"Currently, we work with time series sensor data. Image and audio data processing are on our roadmap. However, if your data is represented as numeric values, such as the MNIST dataset, you can train it on our platform."
is it possible to run the c library generated on an arduino mega 2560?,"It is possible to run the C library generated on an Arduino Mega 2560, but you will need to adapt the library for it. Currently, Arduino is not natively supported on the Neuton platform, but compatibility will be included in future platform updates."
"When selecting the sampling window, does the data get windowed in 1d or 2d?","When selecting the sampling window, the data gets windowed in 1D."
Can I also upload data that is not csv?,You can upload your sensor data either in a .csv format or as a zip archive containing a single .csv dataset inside.
Is there a sample around how the data should be formatted when having multiple features?,"Yes, the data should be labeled and placed in one .csv file. For more details, please refer to our user guide here: https://neuton.ai/st/95-dataset-requirements.html. You can also check our preloaded use cases on the platform to see how the datasets are formatted."
"For testing in Neuton, should I combine all CSV files for a given feature into one?","Yes, you should combine all CSV files for a given feature into one. This is the required format for feeding the data into the platform for testing. Do not shuffle the data! "
Should there be a timestamp column in the data or not?,"No, you should exclude the timestamp column. It does not contribute to signal-defining features, so it is not necessary for training."
"Is it necessary to explicitly specify the start and end of each sample in the data, or can the system infer this information from patterns?","There's no need to explicitly define the start and end of each sample. If your CSV file contains continuous measurements of a single activity, you should add a ‘target’ column to indicate that activity. For instance, if your first CSV file contains accelerometer data for running, you would add a ‘target’ column that specifies the activity (e.g., running). All the rows in this dataset would have the same target value indicating they reflect running. Once you concatenate all your activity datasets into a single file (without shuffling the data), the platform will automatically sort and process everything based on the 'target' column and the windowing settings."
How do I upload test data to validate against?,"To upload a test dataset for validation, simply enable holdout validation by toggling the switch near the ""Holdout Validation"" option on the Dataset tab. After the model finishes training, the metrics will be calculated on the holdout validation dataset. Please ensure that the holdout dataset is in the same format as the training dataset, with identical column names."
Are there API endpoints available for training the Neuton model?,Neuton.ai currently does not provide API access for training. You need to use the platform.
"Hi I am trying to upload previous loaded .cvs file for training dataset, but now your system shows error. Can you tell me why?","According to our logs, your dataset has not enough samples. For your experiment (window size = 128), you need at least 6400 rows of samples in your dataset. 451 rows are not enough for Neuton to process the dataset. However, you can try to reduce the window size and repeat your experiment. Also, judging by our logs, the target variable is represented with only one class instead of two. We recommend you add the second possible outcome to your target variable."
"Hi, does the trained Neuton model work on arm only or it can also run the generated library on my intel cpu?","we offer a downloadable C library compatible with the following platforms: Cortex M0, Cortex M4, Cortex M33, STMicro ISPU, and Microchip-8 series. To run inference on an intel cpu (PC) you can use the inference_runner CLI tool located in the artifacts directory in the downloadable archive."

"When I link the neuton's libneuton_arm_cm4.a with my project, I get errors like: uses VFP register arguments, firmware.elf does not. Is there a way to overcome this?","It seems like yours is compiled with mfloat-abi=softfp and there could be a mismatch because of that. Our library is compiled with -mfloat-abi=hardfp, but Arduino by default compiled with mfloat-abi=softfp, that's why you have this mismatch-mthumb-mcpu=cortex-m4-mfloat-abi=hard-mfpu=fpv4-sp-d16. Currently, Arduino is not natively supported, but compatibility will be included in future platform updates."
"Hi, can I use neuton to run on ESP32?  ",Absolutely!
Can I upload data for you to do modelling?  ,Absolutely. Could you kindly provide details about your data and the specific task you are attempting to accomplish? Please use support@neuton.ai for further communication.
could you tell me why my training stopped? ,"Typically, such errors happen if the requirements for the dataset are not met. Based on our logs, your window size is 52. This means that your data (time series) must contain consecutive readings first from one class, then from another class, then from the third class and so on; and when a window of 52 is applied to the dataset, it will capture consecutive sensor readings for 52 rows of one event many times, then of another event and so forth. The log says that the preprocessed dataset contains 0 records. This usually means that the original data does not have a single event where sensor readings for any class contained a consecutive number of records of window size (52 in your case). "
is it possible that i train the model myself and upload it?,"Unfortunately, uploading your own pre-trained model to the platform is not currently supported. However, we recommend giving our platform a try to create ultra-tiny machine learning models tailored to your needs."

It is written that 15.92% of data was removed. What does that mean?,"This means that during preprocessing, 15.92% of the dataset was removed according to the solution settings. Reasons for data removal: 1. There are classes (activities/gestures) in your dataset that are represented by < 10 examples. 2. During processing data by windows, some windows didn't have enough samples to for a training example for a particular class. 3. If you have defined a 'Session ID' and a window, some combinations of session/window didn't have enough samples to form a valid train sample. You should review the results and decide whether to proceed with training."
What are the blue dots on the chart?,"The blue dots on the chart, labeled as Solution Options, represent different iterations of model growth and construction within a single graph.

Why I can't choose target column for my dataset in anomaly solution?,Anomaly detection models on the Neuton.ai platform are trained in unsupervised fashion. User does not need to provide normal/abnormal data with corresponding target values. All you need to upload is the normal operational sensor data. Neuton will train a model to interpret this as normal operational mode and at inference, if sensor readings will fall out of the normal operational mode ranges, such events will be classified as abnormal.
Does Neuton support collaboration among teams on the same project?,Neuton provides individual user accounts under which users can manage and develop their own projects. However, team-based collaboration on shared projects is not currently supported. Each project is tied to a personal account, and access or editing cannot be shared across multiple users at this time. We recognize the value of team collaboration and are exploring ways to support it in the future.
How does Neuton support hyperparameter tuning?,Neuton executes model training automatically and adjust hyperparameters during training without user input.
Does Neuton support reinforcement learning?,Neuton does not support reinforcement learning. The platform is primarily focused on supervised learning tasks, such as classification and regression, using sensor data as well as unsupervised anomaly detection.
How does Neuton handle imbalanced datasets?,Neuton works great with unbalanced datasets. The platform does not utilize over/undersampling because it changes the statistics of the occurance of classes in real applications and dicreases model's generalization capabilities. For best performance user should manually infer the predicted class by postprocessing the model's predicted probabilities.
What is the typical model training time compared to traditional ML platforms?,Training time varies between several minutes to several hours depending on the dataset size and data complexity. Average training time is within 1 hour.
Are there benchmarks available comparing Neuton’s performance to other AutoML tools?,Neuton.ai benchmarks are available here: https://neuton.ai/frmwrk
Is there GPU support for faster training?,Neuton automatically configures the required training infrastructure subject to the dataset size and complexity. If required, the platform automatically provisions GPU(s).
Can Neuton models be updated incrementally (online learning)?,If you want to update the model with new data, you need to create a new solution and train the model again.
where to find how much I will be charged for the training?,It is absoluytely free! Enjoy.
I am trying to use the model in a nRF54L15. But I have a mistake ld.bfd.exe: failed to merge target specific data of file libneuton.a(neuton_nn_frontend_features.c.obj) what I need to do? error: {file} uses VFP register arguments, {file}.o does not ld: failed to merge target specific data of file {file}.o, This error occurs when there is a mismatch in floating-point (VFP) register usage between different object files during linking, specifically for the nRF54L15 target. The Neuton.AI library for Cortex-m4/Cortex-m33 is compiled with hardware floating-point support by default. Here's what's happening and how to fix it:\nThis typically happens when:\nDifferent compilation flags are used for different source files or libraries\nThe toolchain expects VFP usage but the object file wasn't compiled with VFP support\nThere's a mismatch between your compilation settings and the nRF54L15's capabilities\nSolution:\nEnsure consistent compiler flags:\nMake sure all files are compiled with the same floating-point ABI settings. For nRF54L15 (Cortex-M33), you likely want:\nbash\n-mfloat-abi=hard -mfpu=fpv5-sp-d16\nCheck your toolchain configuration:\nVerify your ARM toolchain supports and is configured for the nRF54L15's floating-point unit.\nModify your Makefile/CMakeLists:\nAdd the correct flags to your build system:\nmakefile\nCFLAGS += -mfloat-abi=hard -mfpu=fpv5-sp-d16\nClean and rebuild:\nAfter changing flags, do a clean rebuild:\nbash\nmake clean && make\nAdditional Notes:\nThe nRF54L15 has a Cortex-M33 with optional FPU, so ensure your project configuration matches your hardware capabilities\nIf mixing libraries, ensure they're all compiled with compatible floating-point options\nCheck your linker script for any floating-point related configurations
